## June 15th

Today, I have planned on what I am going to do for the next month or so. I created a design for this prototype model by hand, and I think it looks pretty cool.

Here is the plan I have devised for myself:

|Date|Plan for dates|Other notes|
|---|---|---|
|15-18|CAD Model designing|Learn fusion 360|
|19-23|PCB designing and adding electronic components to CAD model|Learn KiCAD|
|23-30|Design software for hardware|Learn Inverse Mechanics|

I have also started on the CAD model desigining today, I have created a base for the robot arm.

I want the following features in the chess robot arm:
- Camera Vision of board
- Able to pick and move pieces accurately
- Allows you to play with an adjustable bot (with chess.com api or something)
- (Depends on time) Allows you to play with other players around the world

Time spent today: 4 hours

## July 7th

After two weeks of exams and summer holiday I have come back to this project. The initial timetable plan did not work, so I'm going to proceed without a timetable and see where it leads over the next week or so.

Today, I have redesigned the body and adjusted the dimensions to make it more compact. However, I feared that it could be too light and would topple over too easily. I need to find a way to fix this issue tomorrow.

### Calculations of weight

I also researched on a couple servo motors and found that the MG996R was best suited for this project.
